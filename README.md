**Do not hesitate to fork this repository and contribute.**


### Installation
First of all, you can install your own miniforge with the following command:
```
# we are assuming you are using a bash shell 
# to check which bash you are using `echo $SHELL`
# if you are not using bash, please activate it with `/bin/bash` then 
source install_miniforge.sh
```
This will create a miniforge in the current directory, and install the Xsuite environment.

You can find the examples in the `examples` folder.

If you want to edit this folder, please fork this repository and modified the files in `source`.
Once you are done, you can run 
```
source convert_them.sh
```
from the `source` folder. This operation is automatic if you pull to Github.

Each of this can be used interactively in VSCode, just open it and execute/edit each cell.
