# Tutorial
A tutorial to learn a few things about Xsuite.

First of all, you can install your own miniforge with the following command:
```
source make_it.sh
```
This will create a miniforge in the current directory, and install the Xsuite environment.

You can find the examples in the `examples` folder.

If you want to edit this folder, please fork it and modified the files in `source`.
Once you are done, you can run 
```
source convert_them.sh
```
from the `source` folder.

Each of this can be used interactively in VSCode, just open it and execute/edit each cell.
